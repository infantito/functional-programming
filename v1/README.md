> Functional Programming Light V.1

FP: (Paradigm) It's the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and site-effects.
FP is declarative rather than imperative.

## `What is a function?`

It's a process which takes some input, called **arguments**, and produces some input called a return **value**.
